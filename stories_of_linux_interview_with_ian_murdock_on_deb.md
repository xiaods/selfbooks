If you want to look at the history of Linux, you can hardly escape talking about Debian. Debian has played a major role as part of the Linux ecosystem, and it'd be hard to imagine what the world would look like without it. But it wasn't always a major player — in fact, Debian wasn't even the first Linux distribution. But Debian founder Ian Murdock did things a bit differently, and that has made all the difference.

Debian's history is surprisingly well-documented. The project was founded in 1993, not long after Slackware Linux, but with a much different model of development. Debian started with the Debian Manifesto. (Folks were fond of manifestos in the early days of free software.)

Like Slackware, Debian was a reaction to low-quality Linux distributions (in particular, Softlanding Linux System or SLS). Murdock said that Debian's focus would be "on providing a first-class product and not on profits or returns." Linux was a long way from being a "first-class product" in 1993. Murdock says that Linux "was not that good from a technology perspective... I remember moving files between file systems, and large files would routinely cause kernel panics."

However, the quality of Linux was dwarfed by its potential and its immediate, and free, availability. "I remember like everyone else, my motivation was to solve a problem that I had, I wanted a UNIX to run at home, I was in college and didn't have the money to buy SCO Unix or Coherent, even $99 was a bridge too far for me at the time."

Even though everyone thought that the GNU Hurd, the GNU Project's kernel that never quite lived up to expectations, would be ready "imminently" Linux was available now. And it was not encumbered by the legal issues that were holding up 386BSD. Murdock recounts that its developer William Jolitz "held it very close to the vest," while Linux had an "active, vibrant community."

Another piece of Debian history that many don't know is that Murdock's early work on Debian was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Murdock was sponsored by the FSF for about a year between 1994 and late 1995, and says that the FSF was "enormously helpful" in getting Debian off the ground. Murdock eventually left the FSF to finish his degree.

Despite the FSF connection, Murdock says that the broader perception of Debian as 100% free software from day one "isn't true." In part this can be traced to later developments like Debian's Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines — but those happened during Bruce Perens' tenure, not while Murdock was at the helm.

Debian was mostly free software, but primarily because "just about everything, with a few counter-examples like CDE and Motif, were free software." In the mid-90s, the software one would find on Linux was almost exclusively under free software licenses. But Murdock says that "that's very much something that's evolved over time. In some ways, it's been a hindrance, to be honest."

To this day, Debian carries some reminders of its association with the FSF — for example, Debian is still known as "Debian GNU/Linux," rather than simply "Debian Linux." Today, Murdock says that he "abhors" the term GNU/Linux, but at the time it made sense. "Even before I worked for the FSF, Richard [Stallman] called me one evening and said 'I'm concerned about fragmentation, and I'd like to make a statement that Linux is part of the larger GNU Project."

Murdock says that at the time, fragmentation was a major concern. "There was the libc at the time was a fork from glibc, there were a few other examples — the Linux community had taken GNU software and ran with it, and were not doing a particularly good job of coordinating with upstream GNU maintainers... who couldn't move quickly enough given the pace with which Linux was evolving. Some just gave up on coordinating as a result of that."

As a result, Murdock says that "I thought his argument was reasonable, and I thought his concern about fragmentation was quite valid, so I said 'sure.'" But things have changed, says Murdock. "The reason I abhor the term now, it has very clearly been rejected by the larger community. To insist on continuing to call it something the larger community doesn't use, it seems to me to be a bit pointless."

The good news, however, is that the fragmentation that was considered a problem then has since been fixed.
